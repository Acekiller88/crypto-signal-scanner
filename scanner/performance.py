"""Performance engine (spec §21-22).

Win Rate = Wins / (Wins + Losses). WAITING / EXPIRED / AMBIGUOUS / CANCELLED
are NEVER in the denominator, and every displayed metric carries its sample
size. Profit factor = sum(R of wins) / |sum(R of losses)|.

Every metric is reported twice: GROSS (``winRate``, ``expectancyR``,
``profitFactor``, ``sharpeR``, ``monteCarlo``) and NET of fees + funding
(``winRateNet``, ``expectancyNetR``, ``profitFactorNet``, ``avgCostR``). Gross
is kept for continuity and for diagnosing the setup quality itself; net is the
number that describes what the system would actually have earned. A stop-out
is -1R only when the fill matched the trigger -- gap fills are charged their
true distance (see ``outcomes.r_multiple``).
