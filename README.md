# 📡 Crypto 15-Minute High-Quality Signal Scanner

[![scanner](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAcekiller88%2Fcrypto-signal-scanner%2Fmain%2Ffrontend%2Fdata%2Fbadge.json)](https://github.com/Acekiller88/crypto-signal-scanner/actions)
[![Tests](https://github.com/Acekiller88/crypto-signal-scanner/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Acekiller88/crypto-signal-scanner/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A **zero-cost, production-ready crypto market-analysis and signal-generation system** for the
top-100 liquid Binance USDT-perpetual pairs. It scans every 15 minutes, identifies high-confluence
LONG/SHORT setups using multi-timeframe technical analysis (4H macro → 1H directional → 15M
execution) combined with SMC/institutional price-action logic, publishes them to a professional
dark dashboard, tracks every signal's outcome, and computes statistically honest performance
metrics.

> **This system never executes trades.** It is a quantitative, rule-based market screening and
> signal-analysis tool. It does **not** guarantee profitability and does **not** predict the
> market. The confluence score is a quality ranking, **not** a probability.

## 2. Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> crypto-signal-scanner
cd crypto-signal-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt      # pytest only; the engine is stdlib-only
python -m pytest tests/ -q           # 190 tests must pass
```

## 3. Local execution

```bash
# full live scan (top-100 universe, writes data/ + frontend/data)
python -m scanner.main

# quick partial scan
python -m scanner.main --max-symbols 20
python -m scanner.main --symbols BTCUSDT ETHUSDT      # skip universe build
python -m scanner.main --dry-run                      # no files written

# validate the JSON files (same check CI runs)
python -m scanner.validate_data

# serve the dashboard locally
cd frontend && python -m http.server 8080
# → http://localhost:8080
```

## 4. GitHub Actions setup (the 15-minute scheduler)

1. Create a **new GitHub repository** (e.g. `crypto-signal-scanner`) and push this code:
   ```bash
   git init && git add -A && git commit -m "feat: initial signal scanner"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/crypto-signal-scanner.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. Go to **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** and enable
   **Read and write permissions** (the scan workflow commits JSON updates).
3. The included `.github/workflows/scanner.yml` runs at `*/15 * * * *`
   (00/15/30/45) plus on every push and manual dispatch. It runs the engine,
   validates the JSON, and commits/pushes only when data actually changed.
4. **No secrets are needed.** Public market data only — never add API keys.

Notes:
- GitHub cron can jitter by a few minutes or skip runs under load; the engine
  records `scheduledAt` vs `executedAt` and the dashboard shows the **last
  successful scan** when a run fails.
- Binance geo-blocks some cloud IPs (HTTP 451). The client automatically
  fails over through the configured endpoint chain (canonical futures API →
  futures API mirror → official spot market-data mirror, clearly flagged as a
  degraded source in System Status). See `dataSource.failoverEndpoints` in
  `config/strategy.json`.

## 5. Cloudflare Pages deployment (free hosting)

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git**.
2. Select the repository and branch `main`.
3. Build settings:
   - **Framework preset:** None
   - **Build command:** *(leave empty)*
   - **Build output directory:** `frontend`
4. Save and deploy. Your dashboard is live at
   `https://<project>.pages.dev` — a free subdomain (no paid domain needed).
5. Every scan commit (which updates `frontend/data/*.json`) automatically
   triggers a redeploy — the dashboard data refreshes itself.

The frontend also fetches live prices **directly from Binance in your browser**
(CORS-enabled public ticker) every 20 s and re-reads the JSON every 60 s.
Prices are labelled `LIVE MARKET PRICE` **only** when that browser fetch
succeeds; otherwise they fall back to the scan snapshot and are labelled
accordingly.

### Accessing the dashboard — multiple options

Corporate/security software sometimes flags unknown preview domains (e.g. a
sandbox proxy URL). Don't click through security warnings on a managed device —
use one of these instead:

| Option | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Offline single file** | Download `frontend/dashboard-offline.html` and double-click it | Fully self-contained: the latest data snapshot is embedded in the file; live prices still refresh in-browser when reachable. Rebuilt automatically on every scan, so re-download (or `raw.githubusercontent.com`) for fresh data. |
| **GitHub Pages** (free) | Repo **Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch** → branch `main`, folder `/frontend` | Serves the dashboard at `https://<you>.github.io/crypto-signal-scanner/` — a widely trusted domain. Data updates automatically on every scan commit. |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | See section 5 above | `https://<project>.pages.dev` free subdomain. |
| **Local server** | `cd frontend && python -m http.server 8080` | Requires Python on the machine; gives the full auto-refreshing experience locally. |
| **GitHub itself** | View `frontend/dashboard-offline.html` / `data/*.json` on github.com | Read-only check from anywhere github.com is allowed. |

If a company device blocks even these, ask IT, or view from a personal device
(e.g. phone) — the dashboard is fully responsive.



## 6. Data model

`data/signals.json` — every signal ever generated (persistent history). Each object:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id, symbol, direction, timeframe` | identity (IDs are content-hashed, deterministic) |
| `quality, score, components` | tier (A+/A/B+), 0–100 confluence score and its breakdown |
| `generatedAt, signalCandleCloseTime` | when/on which closed 15M candle it was created |
| `triggerPrice, entryZone, entryPrice` | trigger (buy/sell-stop), zone, and actual fill |
| `stopLoss, takeProfit, riskReward, invalidationLevel` | structure-based levels & RR |
| `marketRegime, htf4hBias, htf1hBias` | 4H regime and both HTF biases at generation |
| `structure, liquiditySweep, bos, choch, displacement, fvg, orderBlock` | SMC context |
| `rsi, adx, atr, atrPercent, relativeVolume, vwap` | indicator snapshot |
| `status` | `WAITING_TRIGGER → TRIGGERED → WIN / LOSS / EXPIRED / AMBIGUOUS / CANCELLED` |
| `expiryAt, tradeMaxDurationMs` | 12×15m trigger expiry; 4h max hold (configurable) |
| `triggeredAt, closedAt, outcome, rMultiple` | lifecycle timestamps and **gross** R result |
| `costR, rMultipleNet` | round-trip fees + funding expressed in R, and the **net** R result |

`data/system-status.json` — scan telemetry (scheduled vs actual time, duration,
universe, API stats, freshness, health) + rolling logs.
`data/market-snapshots.json` — per-scan breadth snapshot (retention-capped).
`data/universe-snapshot.json` — **full top-100 screener snapshot** (overwritten each
scan, no git growth): per-symbol price, 1D/4H/1H bias, regime, RSI, ADX, ATR%,
relative volume, funding rate and open interest — rendered as the sortable
Universe Screener table on the dashboard.
`frontend/data/badge.json` — shields.io endpoint badge (last scan time + health).
`data/performance.json` — headline metrics (the dashboard also recomputes
metrics client-side for its 7D/30D/90D/ALL filters).

**Immutability:** entry, trigger, SL, TP, RR and generation fields are frozen
after creation (`scanner/validation.py` enforces this on every scan) — signals
never repaint. Only current price, status, outcome and timestamps may update.

## 7. Signal methodology (summary)

**Sequence (LONG; SHORT is the mirror):**

4H bullish (or acceptable bullish) **AND** 1H bullish bias **AND** 15M
liquidity sweep **AND** CHoCH/BOS confirmation **AND** bullish displacement
**AND** FVG and/or valid order block **AND** momentum confirmation (RSI band,
ADX established-or-emerging, DI aligned) **AND** volume ≥ 1.2× **AND**
volatility within band **AND** RR ≥ 2.5 → then score ≥ 80 (B+) / 85 (A) /
90 (A+) or **reject**.

**Key definitions** (fully documented in the code and the dashboard's
Methodology section):

- *Swing* — 2-bar strict fractal, usable only 2 bars after its extreme
  (**confirmation index** = the lookahead guard).
- *BOS* — close (never wick) beyond the most recent confirmed swing, with trend.
- *CHoCH* — close against the established trend (character change).
- *Liquidity sweep* — wick beyond a prior confirmed swing (excursion ≤ 1× ATR)
  with a close back inside (stop-hunt rejection proxy).
- *Displacement* — body ≥ 1.5× ATR.
- *FVG* — 3-candle imbalance, gap ≥ 0.1× ATR, known only at the 3rd close.
- *Order block* — last opposite-colour candle before a structure-breaking
  displacement; zone = that candle's range. *(All are price-action proxies —
  no claim of seeing real institutional orders.)*
- *Trigger* — confirmation-candle extreme ± 0.1× ATR (stop-order style), so
  the system never uses "current price" as the entry.
- *Stop* — swept invalidation structure ± 0.5× ATR buffer; rejected if > 3.5×
  ATR ("abnormally large").
- *Take profit* — the nearest **real** swing-liquidity level with RR ≥ 2.5,
  preferring ≥ 3R when available; if structure can't fund the RR, no signal.

**Hard rejections** (regardless of score): HTF conflict · RR < 2.5 · ranging
4H · no momentum (ADX < 15 with no emerging-trend evidence) · thin volume ·
oversized stop · entry pressed against major opposing structure · late entry
after excessive displacement · stale/missing data · duplicate active
same-direction signal · setup-hash cooldown · any integrity failure.

**If there is no valid setup, zero signals are generated.** Nothing is forced.

## 8. Scoring methodology (100 points)

| Component | Points | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| HTF alignment | 20 | 4H 10 + 1H 10 (strong/aligned/neutral scaling) |
| Market structure | 20 | CHoCH/BOS 10 (+5 extra BOS) + displacement 5 |
| Liquidity / SMC | 20 | sweep 10 + FVG 5 + order block 5 |
| Momentum | 15 | RSI band 8 + ADX/DI 7 (emerging-trend credit) |
| Volume | 10 | linear on relative volume 1.0×→2.0× |
| Volatility | 5 | ATR% within band |
| Risk/Reward | 10 | 5 at RR 2.5 → 10 at RR ≥ 3.0 |

Tiers: **A+ ≥ 90 · A ≥ 85 · B+ ≥ 80 · below 80 rejected** (all configurable).

## 9. Win-rate & performance definitions

- **Win rate = wins ÷ (wins + losses)** — `WAITING`, `EXPIRED`, `AMBIGUOUS`,
  `CANCELLED` are never in the denominator; sample size always displayed.
- **Profit factor** = ΣR(won) ÷ |ΣR(lost)|.
- **R is measured from the ACTUAL fill against the PLANNED risk**
  (`|trigger − stop|`, the unit the position was sized against), using that
  single denominator for wins *and* losses. A stop-out after a fill worse than
  the trigger is therefore **more negative than −1R**, and a TP hit is worth
  **less** than the planned RR.
- **Gross vs net** — `winRate`, `expectancyR`, `profitFactor`, `sharpeR` and
  `monteCarlo` are **gross** (no fees). `winRateNet`, `expectancyNetR`,
  `profitFactorNet` and `avgCostR` include taker fees on both legs plus
  perpetual funding (`config/strategy.json → costs`). **Read the net figures.**
- **Cost gate** — a setup whose round-trip cost exceeds `costs.maxCostR`
  (default 0.25R) is **rejected**, not merely scored down: a risk budget
  smaller than the cost of taking it cannot be won. On Binance USDⓈ-M at
  0.05%/side this requires a risk budget of roughly ≥ 0.4% of price.
- **AMBIGUOUS** — TP and SL touched within one 15M candle and 1-minute data
  cannot determine the order. Never counted as a win.
- Breakdowns by direction, quality, regime, score band, symbol and date range.
- No "94% probability"-style claims are ever made — the score is not a
  probability and is never presented as one.

## 10. Backtesting / replay

```bash
python -m scanner.replay --symbols BTCUSDT ETHUSDT --candles 800
python -m scanner.replay --symbols BTCUSDT --determinism-check   # identical input ⇒ identical output
```

Replay walks history candle-by-candle and feeds the engine **only the candles
that had closed at each step** (causal slicing) — signals appear exactly as
they would have live. The determinism check proves byte-identical output.
Reports land in `data/replay-report.json` (git-ignored).

Expect **few signals** — the gate is intentionally strict. On live top-10
pairs, roughly one setup per ~200 symbol-days clears all filters; across the
full 100-pair universe that typically means a handful of signals per day.
Tune `config/strategy.json` to loosen/tighten deliberately.

## 11. Strategy configuration (`config/strategy.json`)

Everything is configurable — indicators, structure detection, model bands,
risk parameters, scoring weights/tiers, lifecycle durations, dedupe/cooldowns,
universe filters, data-source failover chain, retention, sessions/kill-zones,
derivatives context and the optional 1D-bias gate. Highlights:

```jsonc
"indicators": { "emaFast": 20, "emaMid": 50, "emaSlow": 200, "rsiPeriod": 14, ... },
"signalModel": { "minAdx15m": 15, "minRelVolume": 1.20, "rsiLongMin": 45, ... },
"risk": { "minRr": 2.5, "preferredRr": 3.0, "stopBufferAtrMultiple": 0.5, ... },
"scoring": { "minScore": 80, "aPlusThreshold": 90, "aThreshold": 85, "bPlusThreshold": 80 },
"lifecycle": { "triggerExpiryCandles": 12, "tradeExpiryCandles": 16 },
"dedupe":   { "symbolCooldownMinutes": 240 },
"sessions":     { "killZones": [{"name":"LONDON","startUtcHour":7,"endUtcHour":10}, ...] },
"derivatives":  { "enabled": true, "oiTopSymbols": 20, "fundingExtremePct": 0.05, "hardFilter": false },
"bias1d":       { "enabled": true, "requireAlignment": false }
```

**v1.1 context features are display-only by default** — funding/OI, kill-zone
session, 1D bias and premium/discount position enrich signal cards and the
screener without changing the 100-point score or signal behaviour. The
optional hard filters (`derivatives.hardFilter`, `bias1d.requireAlignment`)
are OFF unless you enable them deliberately.

**v1.1 performance metrics**: expectancy (R), max drawdown (R), per-trade R
Sharpe, trigger-vs-fill slippage, Monte Carlo bootstrap (deterministic seed)
and per-tier score calibration with Wilson 95% confidence intervals — all with
explicit sample sizes, all descriptive of past data, never probabilities.

These defaults are **starting parameters validated by the test-suite and
replay — not optimised, not profitable-by-claim**. Backtest before changing
live behaviour.

## 12. Testing

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v          # 190 tests, fully offline
```

Coverage: EMA/RSI/ATR/ADX/RelVol/VWAP (hand-computed vectors) · swing
detection · HH/HL/LH/LL · equal levels · BOS/CHoCH (incl. wick-break
rejection) · displacement · liquidity sweeps (incl. genuine-breakout
exclusion) · FVG · order blocks · scoring & tiers · RR math & target
selection · LONG/SHORT end-to-end models · every hard-rejection rule ·
dedupe/cooldowns · full lifecycle (trigger, gap fill, WIN/LOSS, EXPIRED,
AMBIGUOUS + 1M resolution, max-hold cancel) · immutability/no-repaint ·
win-rate/profit-factor/streaks · validation · offline integration (full scan
pipeline, failure policy, no-lookahead slice stability, replay determinism).

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `HTTP 451 geo-restricted` | Binance blocks the host. The failover chain handles it automatically; if all endpoints fail, host the runner elsewhere or add an allowed mirror to `dataSource.failoverEndpoints`. |
| Workflow doesn't commit | Enable **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write**. |
| "No data changes — skipping commit" | Normal: nothing changed, no empty commits are created. |
| Dashboard shows `price: scan snapshot` | Browser couldn't reach the Binance ticker (network/region). JSON data is unaffected. |
| 0 signals for long stretches | By design. Loosen `scoring.minScore`, `risk.minRr`, or `signalModel` bands deliberately, then replay-test. |
| Scan marked DEGRADED | Some symbols failed or data arrived late; previous valid data retained and warning shown. |

## 14. Known limitations

- **15-minute cadence**: GitHub cron jitter (minutes) means scans are
  near-quarter-hour, not exact; outcome evaluation uses closed candles, so
  intracandle path order is resolved only via 1M data (else AMBIGUOUS).
- **Single data source** (Binance public). Outages degrade the system; no
  simulated data is ever substituted.
- **Spot fallback fidelity**: if both futures endpoints are blocked, the
  official spot market-data mirror is used and flagged — order-flow differs
  slightly from perps.
- **Statistical sample**: high-quality setups are rare; weeks of data may be
  needed before win-rate figures carry meaning (sample sizes are always shown).
- **Not optimised**: default parameters are sensible starting points, not
  curve-fitted edge. No profitability claim is made or implied.
- Ambiguous candles resolved with 1M data consume extra API requests
  (configurable via `lifecycle.resolveAmbiguousWith1m`).
